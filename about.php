You can volunteer with the Kenya Red Cross Society by registering as a volunteer with any of the Branches countrywide. You can also donate in cash or in kind to support the activities of the Kenya Red Cross Society countrywide.

What is the difference between the Red Cross, the Red Crescent and the Red Crystal?
The three symbols are emblems of the Movement. Their main function is identification and protection. They ensure the protection of those wounded in war and those who care for them. Components of the Movement may use them as a form of identification. In such cases they are used in small dimensions so as not to be confused with wartime protective sign. It is strictly forbidden for persons outside the Movement to use them without authorisation.

Where is the Kenya Cross Society Headquarters based?
KRCS headquarters is based Off Mombasa Road, Popo Road, on Red Cross Road, in South ‘C’ Estate, Nairobi.
